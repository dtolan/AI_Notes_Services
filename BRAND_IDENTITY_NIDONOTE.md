## Brand Overview

### Brand Name
**NIDOnote**

### Pronunciation
**NEE-doh-NOTE**

### Brand Essence
NIDOnote (from Italian/Spanish "nido" meaning "nest") represents the safe, warm gathering place where families organize their lives together. Like a nest protects what's precious, NIDOnote protects your family's notes, calendars, and memories in your own personal cloud.

### Brand Positioning
"The family-first workspace that nests in YOUR cloud"

### Core Tagline
"Your family nest for notes, calendar, and events"

### Brand Promise
We provide families with enterprise-grade organization tools while keeping their data safe in their own cloud storage. No one should have to choose between powerful features and privacy.

### Brand Values
1. **Privacy-First**: Your data, your cloud, your control
2. **Family-Focused**: Built for families, not adapted from business software
3. **Warmth**: Technology that brings families closer, not further apart
4. **Accessibility**: Powerful features everyone can use
5. **Trust**: Transparent about data, pricing, and features

## Logo System

### Primary Logo Concept

**The Nest Mark**
```
    ___
   /   \
  | NI- |
  | DO  |
   \___/
    note
```

**Design Concept:**
- Stylized nest shape incorporating the letters "NIDO"
- Warm, rounded curves suggesting safety and comfort
- "NIDO" emphasized in caps within nest shape
- "note" in lowercase beneath, suggesting writing/recording

**Logo Variations:**

1. **Full Logo** (Primary)
   - Nest icon + "NIDOnote" wordmark
   - Use: App icon, website header, marketing materials
   - Minimum size: 120px width

2. **Compact Logo**
   - Nest icon + "NIDO" only
   - Use: Mobile app header, small spaces
   - Minimum size: 40px width

3. **Icon Only**
   - Nest icon without text
   - Use: App launcher icon, favicon, social media profile
   - Minimum size: 32px × 32px

4. **Wordmark Only**
   - "NIDOnote" text (NIDO capitalized)
   - Use: Footer, email signatures, text-only contexts
   - Minimum size: 80px width

### Logo Construction

**Geometric Principles:**
- Based on golden ratio (1.618:1) for visual harmony
- Nest shape uses circular arcs with radius ratios of 1:1.618
- Letter spacing: -2% tracking for "NIDO", normal for "note"
- Vertical alignment: "note" baseline aligns with nest base

**Logo Colors:**

**Full Color (Primary)**
- Nest outline: Nest Brown (#8B6F47)
- "NIDO": Sky Blue (#4A90E2)
- "note": Nest Brown (#8B6F47)

**Monochrome Variations:**
- Dark backgrounds: White (#FFFFFF)
- Light backgrounds: Nest Brown (#8B6F47)
- Single color: Sky Blue (#4A90E2) for digital contexts

**Logo Clear Space:**
- Minimum clear space = height of lowercase "n" in "note"
- No other elements within clear space zone

### Logo Don'ts

❌ **Never:**
- Change the proportions or aspect ratio
- Rotate or skew the logo
- Change letter spacing in "NIDOnote"
- Use drop shadows or 3D effects
- Place on busy backgrounds without clear space
- Recreate or redraw the logo
- Use colors outside approved palette

**If NIDOnote were a person:**
- Warm, caring family member who helps organize gatherings
- Knowledgeable but not condescending
- Trustworthy guardian of precious memories
- Encouraging and supportive
- Unpretentious and approachable

### Voice Attributes

**Warm, Not Cold**
- ✅ "Welcome to your family's nest"
- ❌ "Access your organizational workspace"

**Simple, Not Oversimplified**
- ✅ "Your data stays in your Google Drive, not on our servers"
- ❌ "We keep your stuff safe" (too simple)
- ❌ "Utilizing decentralized storage architecture" (too complex)

**Friendly, Not Casual**
- ✅ "Let's set up your first shared space"
- ❌ "Yo! Let's get this party started!" (too casual)
- ❌ "Proceed to configuration" (too formal)

**Helpful, Not Pushy**
- ✅ "Want to invite family members? You can do that anytime in settings"
- ❌ "Invite 5 people now to unlock full features!" (pushy)

**Human, Not Corporate**
- ✅ "We built NIDOnote because we believe families deserve better tools"
- ❌ "Our enterprise-grade solution delivers synergistic value" (corporate jargon)

### Tone Guidelines by Context

**Onboarding (Welcoming, Encouraging)**
- "Welcome to NIDOnote! Let's create your family's nest."

**Premium Upsell (Valuable, Not Desperate)**
- "Unlock unlimited shared spaces for your growing family"
- "Premium includes AI-powered meal planning and meeting summaries"
- Focus: Value proposition, not scarcity tactics

### Writing Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use contractions (we're, you'll, it's) for warmth
- Address users as "you" and "your family"
- Use active voice ("Create a shared space" not "A shared space can be created")
- Break up long sentences
- Use the nest metaphor naturally, not forced
- Explain technical concepts in human terms
- Be specific ("Connect your Google Drive" not "Connect your storage")

**Don't:**
- Use jargon or technical acronyms without explanation
- Use all caps for emphasis (except NIDO in brand name)
- Make promises you can't keep
- Use fear-based messaging
- Overuse exclamation marks (max 1 per paragraph)
- Use corporate speak or buzzwords
- Talk about "users" (say "families" or "you")

### Vocabulary

**Preferred Terms:**
- Family (not users, customers, subscribers)
- Nest (not workspace, environment)
- Shared space (not folder, directory, room)
- Manager (not admin, owner)
- Guest (not member, user) for free-tier participants
- Your cloud (not our servers, backend)
