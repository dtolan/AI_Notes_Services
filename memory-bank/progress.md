---

## Known Issues

### None - No Issues Identified ✅

The documentation is complete and ready to use. All configurations are syntactically correct.

### Potential Future Considerations

1. **Extension Updates**
   - Extension IDs may change over time
   - Some extensions may be deprecated
   - **Mitigation**: Documentation includes extension IDs that can be updated

2. **VS Code Version Changes**
   - Multi-root workspace API is stable (since v1.70)
   - Future versions should remain compatible
   - **Mitigation**: Documentation states minimum version requirement

3. **Platform Tooling Changes**
   - Android Studio, Xcode, Node.js evolve
   - Build systems may change (Gradle, Xcode)
   - **Mitigation**: Documentation focuses on concepts, not version-specific details

4. **User Environment Variations**
   - Different folder structures
   - Different naming conventions
   - Different team preferences
   - **Mitigation**: Example configuration designed to be easily customized

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Scope
- **Original Request**: Web (React/Node.js) + Android documentation
- **Target**: Developers familiar with VS Code but new to multi-root workspaces

### Scope Expansion
- **User Addition**: iOS/Apple mobile support
- **When**: During planning phase
- **Impact**: All documentation expanded to three platforms
- **Result**: More comprehensive resource

### Documentation Structure Evolution
- **Initial Idea**: Single comprehensive guide
- **Evolution**: Split into three tiers (README → QUICKSTART → Detailed)
- **Rationale**: Serve different user needs and learning styles
- **Result**: Better user experience, more accessible

### Configuration Approach Evolution
- **Initial Idea**: Abstract examples
- **Evolution**: Complete, working configuration file
- **Rationale**: Users can copy-paste and modify immediately
- **Result**: Faster time-to-productivity

### Memory Bank Addition
- **When**: Mid-task
- **User Request**: Implement Memory Bank documentation system
- **Impact**: Added 6 structured documentation files
- **Benefit**: Future context preservation for AI sessions
